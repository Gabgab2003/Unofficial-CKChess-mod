# Unofficial-CKChess-mod
This can display Bannerbased (uses banner names like "White Queen") chessboards in minecraft.

I will probably not develop this any further (even tho a chessbase plugin would be very neat to cheat on skools tournaments). So be happy with this

Planned for the future:
 - Nothing
 
Wont fix:

Instructions:
You need the Fabric Loader, The Fabric API (sepperate) and the LibGUI mod
Press I to open the board GUI, its easiest to use the getpos button while standing in the lower left corner (on a figure) of the board. Also set the spaccing, so for example R##K is a spacing of 3 as you need to move 3 to the next figure. IF you are on the white side, leave the white checkmark clicked, it only changes the numbers on the side
